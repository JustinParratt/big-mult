# big-mult

Extremely fast, low error, sampling based matrix multiplaction algorithm for giant matrices. Implemented in [AssemblyScript](https://docs.assemblyscript.org/) and
tested with [as-pect](https://github.com/jtenner/as-pect);


# *NOTE*
This project is a WIP, it hasn't been published yet because it still needs some glue code to be importable into regular js. This repo will be updated when the package is published and functional.
